# 🐍 Python Healthcare Data Cleaning & Trend Analysis

## 📌 About the Project
This project demonstrates the use of **Python and Pandas** to clean, validate, and analyze a healthcare dataset containing **intentional data anomalies**.  
The objective is to transform raw, imperfect data into a reliable dataset and extract meaningful **trend-based insights** related to patient admissions, length of stay, readmissions, and treatment costs.

This project is designed to showcase **real-world data cleaning skills** commonly required for **Data Analyst roles**.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Healthcare datasets often contain:
- Missing values
- Invalid dates
- Negative or unrealistic numeric values
- Inconsistent records due to manual data entry or system issues

If these issues are not handled correctly, analytical insights can be misleading.  
This project focuses on identifying and resolving such anomalies to enable **accurate trend analysis and decision-making**.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Number of Rows:** 3,552 hospital patient records  
- **Time Range:** January 2023 – June 2025 (based on admission date)  
- **Key Columns:**
  - Patient ID
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Department
  - Diagnosis
  - Admission Date
  - Discharge Date
  - Length of Stay
  - Readmission Indicator
  - Treatment Cost

- **Source:**  
  Synthetic healthcare dataset created for analytical practice.  
  The dataset contains intentional anomalies to simulate real-world healthcare data quality challenges.  
  No real patient or hospital information is included.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Key steps performed in this project:
- Converted date columns to proper datetime format
- Handled missing and invalid values
- Removed duplicate and logically incorrect records
- Recalculated **Length of Stay** using admission and discharge dates
- Created derived features such as:
  - Admission Month
  - Readmission Flag

---

## 📈 Trend Analysis
Using Pandas groupby operations, the following trends were analyzed:
- Monthly patient admissions
- Average length of stay over time
- Monthly readmission rates
- Average treatment cost trends

These trends help identify seasonal patterns and operational pressure points in healthcare delivery.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Patient admissions show clear monthly variation, indicating seasonal demand.
- Average length of stay fluctuates over time, suggesting changes in case complexity or operational efficiency.
- Readmission rates tend to increase during high-admission periods.
- Cleaning data anomalies significantly improves the reliability of analytical outcomes.
